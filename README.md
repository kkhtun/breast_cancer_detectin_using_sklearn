# breast_cancer_detectin_using_sklearn
Using simple machine learning models included in sci-kit learn library to explore their potential in predicting breast cancer. 
Dataset and idea references are described in the main module written in "breast_cancer_detection.ipynb" 

Models applied to this dataset include : 
-Logistic Regression
-K Nearest Neighbor
-Support Vector Machine (Linear Classifier)
-Support Vector Machine (RBF Classifier)
-Gaussian Naive Bayes
-Decision Tree Classifier
-Random Forest Classifier

Feel free to have a look, comment and inspire me new ideas. Thank you.
